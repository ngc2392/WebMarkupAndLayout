              Marketing Communications | Strategy | Events
              
              I'm a critically-thinking creative with nearly 15 years of experience in helping organizations, brands and individuals tell their stories and connect to the people that share their values.
              
              I’m most interested in working in the food/restaurant industry, or with natural beauty and wellness brands.  I also like to help social justice and non-profit organizations do the important work.
              
              Education
              MBA, Eller College of Management, University of Arizona
              BA, Communication, University of Arizona
              Journalism Minor
              
              My Story
              I grew up in Tucson, where I started my marketing career at a boutique, full-service marketing agency that catered mostly to restaurants and high-profile clients. In the nearly six years I spent at the agency, I wore many hats and had the opportunity to dive deep into all aspects of marketing, including public relations, advertising, event planning, and even graphic design.  I transitioned into a marketing director role at one of Tucson’s most famous landmarks, the Historic Hotel Congress and Maynards Market + Kitchen, before I decided to trade desert dwelling for Southern living and made my way to South Carolina.
              
              I started freelancing, which led to a gig as the engagement manager for SOCO, a creative community (and coworking space) in Columbia.  Fast forward through many events, energetic meetings, and a LOT of messages on Slack, and I now direct SOCO’s marketing strategy and I’m a partner in the business. 
              
              After a chance encounter on Columbia’s Main Street and the skip of a heartbeat later, I’ve relocated to the NYC area and continue to freelance, volunteer, and complain about the cold weather. 
              
              What I’ve learned over the years is that I work best when I can really stand by the concept and people behind a project. I'm inspired by the countless brilliant individuals I've come across and I celebrate those who buck tradition to blaze their own paths to better themselves and their communities.
              
              What I Do For Fun
              I enjoy laughing with family and friends, listening to all kinds of music, and reading. I have a lot of interests, but I'm happiest when I'm cooking, baking, eating, and talking about food. Share your fries with me and we'll be best friends.
